## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  I tried to incorporate the Pomodoro method in my workflow by working in 25 minute focused time blocks with 5 minutes break. Sometimes if towards the end of a lesson or exercise I wouldn't skip my break and instead continue until current task is complete. I honestly didn’t strictly follow the Pomodoro technique. Plus the frequent breaks became longer than expected breaks because I would get distracted with something else not work related like tidying up my home. I would take a break, then complete a cleaning task within that break, then resume studying. I did like forcing myself to take the break although it wasn't as often as prescribed or under the 5 minute mark. I was also able to schedule in a short walk outside. It will

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  The intention I set at the beginning of this section was to really give the Pomodoro a chance or at least practice taking more frequent breaks of stepping away from the computer. I definitely wasn’t perfect and didn’t follow all the rules of Pomodoro. I felt less focused and more distracted trying to do the Pomodoro but I may just need more practice.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

  An object is a way to store more complex data. Objects differ from an array because an array stores an ordered list of data that is accessed by the index number. Objects can use an index or a sting to access data. Objects can be treated like a database for storing and organizing data.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class

      - The list of students should be stored in an array. If I wanted a more dynamic list then each student would be represented as an object in order to include properties like `studentName`, `dateOfBirth`, `contactInfo`, `grades`.

  * List of states and their capitals

      - The list of states should be stored in an array. And each state would be represented as an object with a property and parameter representing the `stateName` and `stateCapital`.

  * List of things to pack for vacation

      - The list of things to pack for vacation should be stored in an array because we are collecting a list of items.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow

      - The list of Instagram names should be stored in an array because we are only collecting a list of names.

  * List of student names and their cohort

      - The list of students should be stored in an array. Each student will be stored in an object with a property and parameter representing the `studentName` and `cohort`.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake

      - The list of ingredients should be stored in an array. And each ingredient would be represented as an object with a property and parameter representing the `ingredientName` and the `quantity`.

  * All my favorite restaurants

      - The list of favorite restaurants should be stored in an array because we are storing a list of `restaurantNames`. If I needed to store additional informational about each restaurant then I'd create an object for each restaurant.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

  - Spotify playlist object can have the keys: playlistName, playlistAuthor, playlistDateCreated, playlistLastUpdated, numberTracks, genre.

  - Here you can see the keys with assigned values:
  playlistName: "Study focus music",
  playlistAuthor: "Gary Snails",
  playlistDateCreated: "2021-4-1 15:48",
  playlistLastUpdated: "2021-9-30 1:00",
  numberTracks: 53,
  genre: "classical"


1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
  - Do you have any recommended resources of coding exercises with classes and objects? I definitely need more practice coding and simply reading instructions and determining what is being asked.
