## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
      * I try to read as much as possible to get a better understanding of new concepts. I would like to be more intentional in eating healthy snacks to fuel my brain power. Also, I need to practice taking short breaks throughout the day which helps with memory retention.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
      * Boolean is a data type that can have one of two values, true or false. Booleans are helpful in determining which script to run.
      * Number is a data type that handles all numbers, including:
          * negative numbers like (-27)
          * decimals like one quarter (0.25)
      * String is a data type that represents letters and other characters. Strings must be wrapped in single or double quotes.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
      * `console.log("Hello World!");`

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
      * single-line comments would use `// type text here`
      * multi-line comments use `/* type longer text here to explain your code */`
      * Code comments makes your code easier to read and understand. It helps you and others read your code.
      * Comments are also used to comment out pieces of code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
      * A variable is like a nickname we give to someone or something.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
      * Three variables used on Target website could be: `userName`, `userPurchaseHistory`, and `userAge`. `userName` and `userPurchaseHistory` are string data types. And `userAge` is a number data type.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
      * Concatenation is the joining of strings and other data types. The plus (+) operator is used to join the data types together to create a string.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
      * A retail site that I recently made a purchase on could use concatenation to send an email regarding my recent purchase. For example, "Lauralyn, your 7 items are on its way!". This example would look like this:  
      ``` javascript
      var userName = "Lauralyn"
      var numItems = 7
      var emailItemsSent = userName + ", your " + numItems + " items are on its way!"

      console.log(emailItemsSent)
      ```
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
      * I was having a hard time with images in Markdown. It took me a while to find the proper image extension to place into my Markdown. Even when google searching by the filetype. Also, I still need practice with formatting basics like line spacing. Watching a video on Youtube helped me to see Markdown in action.
      * I was unable to access the Turing Terminal in section1 PartB
      * There are exercises that ask to write an explanation in a .js file, for example, variables.js. Should we console log or comment out the explanation?
