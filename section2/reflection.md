## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

  When asking for help, I think I fall in between. I try to figure out the solution on my own and continue if I've made progress. I know to reach out after 20-30 minutes of no progress. And I have reached out in the past when I was stuck.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  I felt good because the resources provided were efficient. I liked there was a variety of resources (textbook, blog post, Codecademy lessons, and a video tutorial). I found it helpful to get different versions of the same material.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  A `conditional` statement is used to determine what code should be executed next. `if statements` are used to introduce a `condition`.

  One example: If it's raining then I will wear my rain boots. If it isn't raining, then I will not wear my rain boots.

  Second example: If gamer's age is strictly equal to 13 or if gamer's age is greater than 13 then gamer is given access to play online game.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  I can add multiple `conditions` to an `if` statement by using `else if` statements.
When a `condition` is evaluated as `true` then the block of code is executed. If none of the conditions are `true`, then the block of code that follows the `else` statement is executed.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

  I can use a `logical operator` to check that two `conditions` are met.

  I can use `if else` statements to check that 1 of two `conditions` are met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

  I read about "truthy" and "falsey" statements; and anonymous `functions`. Are these concepts something I should just be aware of at low level for now?
