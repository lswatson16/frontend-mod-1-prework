## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  1. "Don't compare yourself to others." I have to remind myself that everyone learns at different paces. My process of learning may take longer than others so I have to stay focused on my progress and just keep going. I know I'm fully capable of learning the material and have to avoid getting discouraged.
  1. Normalizing that we all struggle was another good point. Also, struggles shouldn't be demotivating, but instead they should be taken in as a learning opportunity.
  1. Acknowledging that we all have areas that we may have a growth mindset while still being fixed in other aspects of life. We should be aware of it and actively work on improving those areas that we have a fixed mindset.  

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  I demonstrate a growth mindset when it comes to learning a coding language and cooking. I believe in myself, and that with time, effort and practice, I will get better in the skill.

  I don't demonstrate a growth mindset when I have thoughts that place limits on my growth and progress in personal bad habits.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

  One example of an array is the Google Photos app. The images are a collection of items that would be stored in an array.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

  Array methods allow you to interact with the array. For example, `push` is an array method that adds an item to the end of an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

  Loops are useful when you want to repeat a certain task a specific amount of times. We can create a loop that logs ``"Hello Beautiful!"`` 177 times.

  When we use loop in conjunction with an array, we are iterating through each piece of data in our collection. For example, we can iterate through an array of foods; and log each food item in the string "Alexa has added _(foodItem)_ to your grocery list."

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

  Let's say I give you a $1 for every second you can stand on one foot. You can choose only one foot to stand on which will start the timer. Once both feet touch the ground then I will stop giving you $1. You cannot switch feet. If you switch feet or fall that will stop the timer and I will stop giving you $1.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

  What's an example of a situation where you would want to use the for loop in reverse order?
